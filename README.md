# Animated Square Image Splitter

This UI project is just one of the many custom animations I made for an [app]([url](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nullinnix.artgpt)). 

Screenshots of how the app looks

> [!TIP]
> You can drag on the sliders to change the blunder rate or how fast the images are spawned.

### Testing it out
You can install the [APK]([url](https://github.com/PhoenixJatrix/Animated-Square-Image-Splitter/blob/main/app-release.apk)) or just use the raw code and edit as needed

> [!NOTE]
> It does't look or function as it does in the base [app]([url](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nullinnix.artgpt)). Some code is redacted and stripped from this repo
